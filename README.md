# multisegmentScale
Primarily useful for plots with chromosomes displayed sequentially, such as Manhattan plots, circos plots, or in Dot. Acts like a regular scale but takes a key to a segment followed by the position within that segment and outputs a number for the relative position along the total length of that genome.
